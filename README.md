# Matrix-Alertmanager
foobar

![](./screenshot.png)

A bot to receive Prometheus Alertmanager webhook events and forward them to chosen rooms.

Main features:

* Uses pre-created Matrix user to send alerts using token auth
* Configurable room per alert receiver
* Automatic joining of configured public rooms on start up
* Secret key authentication with Alertmanager

## How to use

### Configuration

Whether running manually or via the Docker image, the configuration is set via environment variables. When running manually, copy `.env.default` into `.env`, set the values and they will be loaded automatically. When using the Docker image, set the environment variables when running the container.

### Docker

The [Docker image](https://cloud.docker.com/repository/docker/jaywink/matrix-alertmanager) `jaywink/matrix-alertmanager:latest` is the easiest way to get the service running. Ensure you set the required environment variables listed in `.env.default` in this repository.

### Alertmanager

You will need to configure a webhook receiver in Alertmanager. It should looks something like this:

```yaml
receivers:
- name: 'myreceiver'
  webhook_configs:
  - url: 'https://my-matrix-alertmanager.tld/alerts?secret=veryverysecretkeyhere'
```

The secret key obviously should match the one in the alertmanager configuration.

NOTE! Currently the bot cannot talk HTTPS, so you need to have a reverse proxy in place to terminate SSL, or use unsecure unencrypted connections.

## TODO

* HTTPS support without reverse proxy
* Better test coverage
* Nicer formatting of messages
* Registering an account instead of having to use an existing account
* Joining rooms that are configured automatically
