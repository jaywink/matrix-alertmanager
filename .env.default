# Custom alert links in format "name1:url_template1|name2:url_template2"
# URL templates can include placeholders:
# - {generatorURL}: The original alert URL
# - {labels.xxx}: Any label from the alert (e.g., {labels.instance}, {labels.alertname})
# - {annotations.xxx}: Any annotation from the alert (e.g., {annotations.summary})
# If a url entry is a singular annotation and the annotation exists in data
# received from AlertManager then it will be used as the url. If the annotation
# doesn't exist then this particular name is skipped completely.
# Example: ALERT_LINKS=Grafana:{annotations.grafana}|Silence:https://alertmanager.example.com/#/silences/new?filter={labels.alertname}|Multiple words or emojisðŸ“ˆ:{generatorURL}
